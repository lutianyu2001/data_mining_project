# Data Mining Project Repository

Group 32

Currently there will only have datasets we have used and our application result, for the code please see the zip file uploaded to iSpace. 

Also, after the final grade published, the codes will be uploaded here for record.

The raw datasets are not included here as you can download it on the website we specified in our report, and you are strongly recommanded to use our 
processed datasets uploaded here as data preprocessing really takes time and computer resource.

Some data files are too big to be uploaded directly, therefore we zipped it, you shall unzip it an put it in the same folder of all the other datasets.

The applicaton result is uploaded at "result" folder, and it is only for you evaluation, you **DO NOT** need it for executing our program.
