# data mining project repository

Currently there will only have datasets we have used and our application result, after the final grade published, the codes will be uploaded.

The predict_data_wordCut.csv is too big to be uploaded directly, therefore we zipped it, you shall unzip it an put it in the same folder of all the other datasets.

The applicaton result is uploaded at "result" folder, and it is only for you evaluation, you **DO NOT** need it for executing our program.
